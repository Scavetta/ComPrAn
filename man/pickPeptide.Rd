\usage{
pickPeptide(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{a dataframe}
}
\value{
a dataframe
}
\description{
This function selects a single unique peptide to represent each Protein Group Accession
There are 2 ways of selecting peptides, both are perform as they are needed for different tasks later on
1) Scenario A: select peptide occuring in most fractions, do this individually for labelled/unlabelled
(max value for any peptide is equal to number of fractions) in case of ties, pick
peptide whith highest Precursor Area in any fraction
2) Scenario B: select peptide occuring in most fractions counting both label states together
(max value for any peptide is equal to twice the number of fractions)
in case of ties, pick peptide with highest Precursor Area in any fraction.
Representative peptide in Scenario B is picked only for proteins that have
at least one shared peptide between label states.

\examples{

##Use example peptide data set, read in and clean data
inputFile <- system.file("extdata", "data.txt", package = "ComPrAn")
peptides <- cleanData(data.table::fread(inputFile), fCol = "Search ID")
## separate chemical modifications and labelling into separate columns
peptides <- splitModLab(peptides) 
## remove unneccessary columns, simplify rows
peptides <- simplifyProteins(peptides) 
##make environment
peptide_index <- makeEnv(peptides)
## Pick representative peptide for each protein for both scenarios
for(i in names(peptide_index)){assign(i,pickPeptide(peptide_index[[i]]),envir=peptide_index)}
